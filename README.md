# Head First Design Patterns

### [The Strategy Pattern](/strategy/)
**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

### [The Observer Pattern](/observer/)
**The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
