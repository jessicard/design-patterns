# Head First Design Patterns

My written examples from the book [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/). Written in Java using IntelliJ.

Actual example code released [here](/publisher-code).

### [The Strategy Pattern](/strategy/)
**The Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.

### [The Observer Pattern](/observer/)
**The Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### [The Decorator Pattern](/decorator/)
**The Decorator Pattern** attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

### [The Factory Method Pattern](/factory/)
**The Factory Method Pattern** defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

## OO Basics
1. **Abstraction**
1. **Inheritance**
1. **Encapsulation**
1. **Polymorphism**

## OO Principles
1. Encapsulate what varies.
1. Favor composition over inheritance.
1. Program to an interface, not an implementation.
1. Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
1. **The Open-Closed Principle** - Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
